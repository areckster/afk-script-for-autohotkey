afk script to get spiritual projection in avatar the last airbender roblox/elimental adventures
press q to begin the script's execution. it seems that I cant make a keybind stop it, so you just have to exit the script by right clicking it's icon down in the toolbar(that little up arrow near the time and stuff)
FULL TUTORIAL:
1. make a new script, to make one right click on your home page(where your background for your computer is) and go to the "new" catagory, press autohotkey script
2. give it a name, then right click it and click edit, delete all the other stuff thats autofilled into the script, it should say something like this: #NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
  ; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
  SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
  SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
3. paste in the stuff I put in the code area
4. press the file button in the top left of your script, click save as, and give it a name
5. now its time to try it out, head into the game, choose a save slot to use, and once your at the place where it says either just new game, or new game, customize, continue, press the q key on your keyboard, and let the grinding begin!

faq.

question: how do I know it got me spiritual projection?

answer: to know it got you spiritual projection, you can make a screen recording(thats what I did at least) and when it says that youve been idle for 20 minutes or you see the script has stopped running, you can check your video to see if you got it!


question: how can I stop it?

answer: so at the moment I cant seem to find a way to make a key stop it, so for now you just have to right click on its little icon in the toolbar(its normally in the little up arrow place near the date and time) and press exit script. I found it easier to drag the script out of that area and put it where I can easily end the script, just make sure to do that before you start it, otherwise you'll probably never manage to get it out in time!
